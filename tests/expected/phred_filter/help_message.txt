VCFX_phred_filter: Filter VCF lines by their QUAL field.

Usage:
  VCFX_phred_filter [options] < input.vcf > output.vcf

Options:
  -p, --phred-filter <VAL>      Phred QUAL threshold (default=30)
  -k, --keep-missing-qual       Treat '.' (missing QUAL) as pass
  -h, --help                    Display this help and exit

Description:
  Reads VCF lines from stdin. For each data line, parse the QUAL field.
  If QUAL >= threshold => print line. Otherwise, skip. By default, missing
  QUAL ('.') is treated as 0. Use --keep-missing-qual to treat '.' as pass.

Examples:
  1) Keep variants with QUAL>=30:
     VCFX_phred_filter -p 30 < in.vcf > out.vcf
  2) Keep missing QUAL lines:
     VCFX_phred_filter -p 30 --keep-missing-qual < in.vcf > out.vcf
