VCFX_cross_sample_concordance: Check variant concordance across multiple samples.

Usage:
  VCFX_cross_sample_concordance [options] < input.vcf > concordance_results.txt

Options:
  -h, --help    Display this help message and exit

Description:
  Reads a multi-sample VCF from stdin, normalizes each sample's genotype
  (including multi-allelic variants), and determines if all samples that
  have a parseable genotype are in complete agreement. Prints one row per
  variant to stdout and a final summary to stderr.

Example:
  VCFX_cross_sample_concordance < input.vcf > results.tsv
