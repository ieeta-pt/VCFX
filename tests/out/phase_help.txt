VCFX_phase_checker: Output only VCF variant lines in which every sample genotype is fully phased.

Usage:
  ./VCFX_phase_checker [options] < input.vcf > phased_output.vcf

Options:
  -h, --help   Display this help message and exit

Description:
  The tool reads a VCF from standard input and checks the GT field (genotype) for each sample.
  A genotype is considered fully phased if it uses the '|' separator (e.g., "0|1") and contains
  no missing alleles. If every sample in a variant line is fully phased, the line is printed to
  standard output; otherwise, it is skipped and a warning is written to standard error.

Examples:
  To extract only fully phased variants:
    ./VCFX_phase_checker < input.vcf > phased_output.vcf
