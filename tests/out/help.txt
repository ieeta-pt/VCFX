VCFX_indel_normalizer: Normalize INDEL variants by splitting multi-allelic lines,
and removing common leading/trailing bases to produce a minimal left-aligned representation.

Usage:
  VCFX_indel_normalizer [options] < input.vcf > output.vcf

Description:
  This code does a simplified left alignment that:
   1) Splits multi-ALT lines into separate lines.
   2) Removes the longest shared prefix from REF/ALT, adjusting POS.
   3) Removes the largest shared suffix from REF/ALT.

  Note: true left alignment for repeated motifs requires the full reference genome.

Example:
  VCFX_indel_normalizer < input.vcf > normalized.vcf
