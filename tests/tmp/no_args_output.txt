VCFX_population_filter: Subset VCF to samples in specified population.

Usage:
  VCFX_population_filter [options] < input.vcf > output.vcf

Options:
  --help, -h               Print this help.
  --population, -p <TAG>   Population tag to keep (e.g. 'EUR','AFR', etc.)
  --pop-map, -m <FILE>     Tab-delimited file: 'SampleName <tab> Population'

Description:
  Reads the pop map, finds samples that match the chosen population.
  Then reads the VCF from stdin and prints lines with only those sample columns.
  If a sample is not in that population, it's dropped from the #CHROM header and data columns.

Example:
  VCFX_population_filter --population AFR --pop-map pops.txt < input.vcf > out.vcf
