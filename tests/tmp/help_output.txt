VCFX_quality_adjuster: Apply a transformation to the QUAL field of a VCF.

Usage:
  VCFX_quality_adjuster [options] < input.vcf > output.vcf

Options:
  -h, --help               Show this help.
  -a, --adjust-qual <FUNC> Required. One of: log, sqrt, square, identity.
  -n, --no-clamp           Do not clamp negative or large values.

Description:
  Reads each line from VCF. If it's a data line with >=8 columns, we parse
  the QUAL field (6th col). We transform it with <FUNC>, e.g.:
    log => log(QUAL + 1e-10)
    sqrt=> sqrt(QUAL)
    square=> (QUAL * QUAL)
    identity=> no change
  By default, negative results from e.g. log are clamped to 0, and large
  results are capped at 1e12. If you do not want clamping, use --no-clamp.

Examples:
  1) Log-transform:
     VCFX_quality_adjuster --adjust-qual log < in.vcf > out.vcf
  2) Square, keep negative or big values as is:
     VCFX_quality_adjuster --adjust-qual square --no-clamp < in.vcf > out.vcf
