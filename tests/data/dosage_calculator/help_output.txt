VCFX_dosage_calculator: Calculate genotype dosage for each variant in a VCF file.

Usage:
  VCFX_dosage_calculator [options] < input.vcf > dosage_output.txt

Options:
  -h, --help    Display this help message and exit

Description:
  For each variant in the input VCF, the tool computes the dosage for each sample
  based on the genotype (GT) field. Dosage is defined as the number of alternate
  alleles (i.e. each allele > 0 counts as 1). Thus:
    0/0  => dosage 0
    0/1  => dosage 1
    1/1  => dosage 2
    1/2  => dosage 2  (each alternate, regardless of numeric value, counts as 1)

Example:
  VCFX_dosage_calculator < input.vcf > dosage_output.txt
