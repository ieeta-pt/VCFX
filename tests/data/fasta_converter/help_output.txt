VCFX_fasta_converter: Convert a variant-only VCF into simple per-sample FASTA.

Usage:
  VCFX_fasta_converter [options] < input.vcf > output.fasta

Description:
  Reads a VCF with diploid genotypes and writes a FASTA file. Each variant
  line becomes one position in the FASTA alignment. For multi-allelic sites,
  each sample's genotype is interpreted to produce a single IUPAC base
  (if heterozygous with different single-base alleles) or 'N' if ambiguous.

  Indels, multi-base alleles, or complicated genotypes default to 'N'.

Example:
  VCFX_fasta_converter < input.vcf > output.fasta
