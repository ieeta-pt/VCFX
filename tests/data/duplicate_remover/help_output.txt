VCFX_duplicate_remover
Usage: VCFX_duplicate_remover [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --help, -h               Display this help message and exit.

Description:
  Removes duplicate variants from a VCF file based on the combination of
  chromosome, position, REF, and ALT alleles. For multi-allelic records, the
  ALT field is normalized by sorting the comma-separated alleles so that the
  ordering does not affect duplicate detection.

Example:
  ./VCFX_duplicate_remover < input.vcf > unique_variants.vcf
